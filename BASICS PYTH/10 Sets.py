# --------- Set is unoedered collection of data items . 
# As they are unordered so we can't change them
# Also sets don't contain duplicate items

# s = {1,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,"Dance"}    
# print(s)                        # As it's a set so the duplicate 2 will be rmoved from the result
# print(type(s))

# s_new = set()            #This is an empty set, {} can't be use as it is dictnory
# print(s_new)
# print(type(s_new))            

# s2 = {12.5 ,3 , 10, "dance", 55 , "funny", 9}         
# print(s2)                                     # As sets are unordered collection so result might be in different order
